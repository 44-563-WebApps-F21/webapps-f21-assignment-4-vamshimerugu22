    <h4 class= "LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h4>  <p class= "speech">  [_Strongly_.]  Oh, fight in any case—in any case.</p><br>
    
    <h4 class= "SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h4>  <p class= "speech"> [_With a gesture of despair_.]  If my wife found
        out, there would be little left to fight for.  Well, as soon as I hear
        from Vienna, I shall let you know the result.  It is a chance, just a
        chance, but I believe in it.  And as I fought the age with its own
        weapons, I will fight her with her weapons.  It is only fair, and she
        looks like a woman with a past, doesn’t she?</p><br>
        
    <h4 class= "LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h4>  <p class= "stagedirection">[Taking off his left-hand glove.]</p>  <p class= "speech">Most pretty women do.  But there is a fashion in pasts just
as there is a fashion in frocks.  Perhaps Mrs. Cheveley’s past is merely
a slightly décolleté one, and they are excessively popular nowadays.
Besides, my dear Robert, I should not build too high hopes on frightening
Mrs. Cheveley.  I should not fancy Mrs. Cheveley is a woman who would be
easily frightened.  She has survived all her creditors, and she shows
wonderful presence of mind.</p><br>
    
    <h4 class= "SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h4> Oh! I live on hopes now.  I clutch at every chance.
    I feel like a man on a ship that is sinking.  The water is round my feet,
    and the very air is bitter with storm.  Hush! I hear my wife’s voice. <p class= "speech"> </p><br>

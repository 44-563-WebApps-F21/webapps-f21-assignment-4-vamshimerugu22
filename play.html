                    disappointed.  I wanted my success when I was young.  Youth is the time
                    for success.  I couldn’t wait.</p><br>

                    But how did he do it?  Tell me the whole thing.</p><br>

                    writing-table_.]  One night after dinner at Lord Radley’s the Baron began
                    talking about success in modern life as something that one could reduce
                    to an absolutely definite science.  With that wonderfully fascinating
                    quiet voice of his he expounded to us the most terrible of all
                    philosophies, the philosophy of power, preached to us the most marvellous
                    of all gospels, the gospel of gold.  I think he saw the effect he had
                    produced on me, for some days afterwards he wrote and asked me to come
                    and see him.  He was living then in Park Lane, in the house Lord Woolcomb
                    has now.  I remember so well how, with a strange smile on his pale,
                    curved lips, he led me through his wonderful picture gallery, showed me
                    his tapestries, his enamels, his jewels, his carved ivories, made me
                    wonder at the strange loveliness of the luxury in which he lived; and
                    then told me that luxury was nothing but a background, a painted scene in
                    a play, and that power, power over other men, power over the world, was
                    the one thing worth having, the one supreme pleasure worth knowing, the
                    one joy one never tired of, and that in our century only the rich
                    possessed it.</p><br>

                    SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Rising_.]  I didn’t think so then.  I don’t think
                    so now.  Wealth has given me enormous power.  It gave me at the very
                    outset of my life freedom, and freedom is everything.  You have never
                    been poor, and never known what ambition is.  You cannot understand what
                    a wonderful chance the Baron gave me.  Such a chance as few men get.LORD GORING.  Fortunately for them, if one is to judge by results.  But
                    tell me definitely, how did the Baron finally persuade you to—well, to do
                    what you did?</p><br>

                    could give him any private information of real value he would make me a
                    very rich man.  I was dazed at the prospect he held out to me, and my
                    ambition and my desire for power were at that time boundless.  Six weeks
                    later certain private documents passed through my hands.</p><br>
